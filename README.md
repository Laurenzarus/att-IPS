# att-IPS
My component of the AT&amp;T Case Hack solution my group, Sophomore Slump, came up with. I was tasked with the front-end webpage that would be seen by public leaders wanting to use our app.

### AT&T Case_v1.0.pdf
This is the file that should probably be viewed first. It contains the slide deck that was used to present our case to the panel of judges. Created primarily by USC MBA students Kelly Mak and Ferra Chen, it outlines the problem we identified and the 
solution we came up with, along with many of the business and finance relevant points that would go into such a project.

### index.html
This file was the page that was shown in my part of the demo. The Integrated Parking System was intended to be integrated into 
AT&amp;T's existing Smart Cities Operations Center, which gives public leaders an all-in-one easily accessible view of 
different kinds of important data. Compared to the average user, we believed that the public leader would be more likely to 
use a web interface rather than a mobile app, so I created this webpage using Bootstrap and jQuery to show the judges.

### index.scss
The SCSS file that contains the styling for index.html. I used the Scout-App to compile the SCSS into CSS.

### slick
Contains the resources needed to implement the slick jQuery carousel. The details of the implementation can be found here on the slick website: http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/
